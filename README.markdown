# Jake Bixby's vim dotfiles

This is my current dotfile setup. I'm still learning vim, and don't make use of all of the plugins by any means.

I use [MacVim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/downloads) exclusively.

I started off with [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus), but then slowly transferred towards using my own setup, managing my plugins with [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). I've got a few
extra syntax files included, mostly for actionscript and html5.
